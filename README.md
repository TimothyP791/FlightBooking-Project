# FlightBooking
This is a flight booking project that I built myself where read data from a file and store it into a singly linked list with the functionality allowing the user to view, book, and cancel flights as well as print out a flight ticket for eventual boarding. This is more of a first draft and I may return and add more functionality in the future.
